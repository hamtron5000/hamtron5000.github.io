<p>My name is Andy Hamilton and I am a neophyte IT guy. I work in healthcare but am passionate about free and open-source software and the dissemination of knowledge more broadly.
<p>I'm currently running a 2019 Dell XPS 15 9570 which dual-boots Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04.2.0. I have a preference for intense keyboards and currently have and use a ZSA Moonlander keyboard and a Fujitsu Realforce R2. My mouse of choice is the Logitech MX Master M2. 
<p>For software, I spend most of my time in various browsers - my default these days is Opera, but I use Firefox almost as reguarly. I'm trying Brave and keep Chrome around for miscellaneous needs and testing. I'm also a dedicated Tor supported and so use Tor browser when it's appropriate.
<p>For messing around in Python, I use IDLE. For messing around in HTML, I use Notepad (I know, I know...). I use Github Desktop a little bit.
<p>Outside of tech, I am passionate about the outdoors and am a proud ecosocialist. My spiritual practice is Buddhism, though my fiance is Catholic. I drive a Subaru and am in many ways a Colorado stereotype, except that I don't much care for beer.
